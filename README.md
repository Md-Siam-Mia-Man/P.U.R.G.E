## 📖 Summary

Welcome to **P.U.R.G.E.**! 📱 This is a native debloater GUI built from scratch in Rust and `egui` for a fast, responsive, and truly cross-platform experience. Our mission is to help you reclaim your device's privacy and battery life by making it dead simple to remove unnecessary system apps. A leaner device also means a smaller [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface), hardening your security.

Packages are documented to give you a clear idea of what's safe to remove. The worst-case scenario is a bootloop, but don't panic! After about 5 failed boots, your phone will enter recovery mode, where you can perform a factory reset.

**Bottom line: You CANNOT permanently brick your device with this software!**
